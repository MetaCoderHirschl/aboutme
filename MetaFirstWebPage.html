    	<p style="font-family:Times">Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away, a long time ago, I was a brewing supervisor, then I made Pepsi, which is not beer.  This upset the brewing company since the brewing company wanted beer, not Pepsi, but Pepsi was impressed I made Pepsi, so I made more. Then I went back to school. Now that was fun. Then I was a geek at Arthur Andersen & Co. where I coded in COBOL for mainframes. They called me Meta-Data.</p>
    	<p style="font-family:Times">Then I got really really sick and couldn't breathe <em>gasp!</em>, but I can hold my breath for a really really long time, and survived. I struggled mightily and finally, through yoga, got tons better, but I had to do a lot of changing. Including divorce, moving, and changing careers. I became a yoga teacher, author, studio owner. Then I was called Meta-ji.</p>
     	<p style="font-family:Times">Then I got quite tired of the yoga <strike>profession</strike> business. I loved to teach and then, I got tired of it. So, I became a geek again. It's all new and all the same too.</p>
