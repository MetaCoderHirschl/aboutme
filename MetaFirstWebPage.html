    <p style="font-family:Arial">Once I was a brewing supervisor, then I made Pepsi. Then I went back to school. Now that was fun. Then I was a geek at Arthur Andersen & Co where I coded in COBOL for mainframes. They called me Meta-Data then.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial">Then I got really really sick and couldn't breathe. I struggled mightily and finally, through yoga, got tons better, but I had to do a lot of changing. Including divorce, moving, changing careers. I became a yoga teacher, author, studio owner. Then I was called Meta-ji.
    </p>
     <p style="font-family:Arial">Then I got really really tired of the yoga profession, or should I say, lack of profession. So, I became a geek again. It's all new and all the same too. And I say, yogi in techie, techie in yogi.
